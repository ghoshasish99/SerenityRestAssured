  Scenario Outline: SEPA payments for a senior citizen
    Given I create a customer with "<FirstName>", "<LastName>", "<Age>","<EmailID>","<Nationality>","<Date>"
    And   I create an account of type "<AccountType>"
    When  I debit the account with "<TransactionAmount>" and credit internal account
